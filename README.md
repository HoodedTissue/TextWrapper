# TextWrapper
automate putting linebreaks in script

tested with [Plastic Memories](https://vndb.org/v19441), may work with other games that use emote but you may have to manually change the width for the text box and characters

use [this](https://github.com/HoodedTissue/KiriKiriSCNJSONParser) to parse the text from .scn files into a .txt document.
